This is a Cordova-based application for playing an Icecast stream. 

Specifically, Cordova-TypeScript-WebPack.

## Modifying

At some point all the configuration options will be moved to a single file. Until this is the case, you have to go diving for the stream URL etc.

## Installation

Firstly, `npm install` to install all the node modules you need.

Run `webpack`. Then copy the `www` directory to your web server.
